## Machine Learning for Public Policy

#### This repository includes some assignments and labs that I completed as part of a course called "Machine Learning for Public Policy" (Spring, 2017). Some of the tasks that I completed and the skills that I learned are:

- using the U.S. Census Bureau API to scrap data regarding socio-economic characteristics of different neighborhoods (tracts/blocks) in Chicago. **(PA1)**
- pre-processing data (dealing with missing values, one-hot encoding, standardization and selecting important features) to make it ready for the machine learning phase. **(PA2)**
- using different machine learning techniques (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, gradient boosting) to predict delinquincy of loan borrowers. **(PA3/Labs)**
- applying evaluation metrics (AUC, ROC, and Precision/Recall rates) to evaluate the accuracy and predictive power of the machine learning model. **(PA4/Labs)**
